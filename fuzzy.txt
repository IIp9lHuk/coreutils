fuzzy - print the time... ish

SYNOPSIS
--------
fuzzy [_-n_]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

_Fuzzy_ prints the current time of day in a human readable form. It does so in
a roundabout, inaccurate fashion; it will be a maximum of 3 minutes off the
correct time.

_Fuzzy_ understands _five_, _ten_, fifteen (_quarter_), _twenty_,
_twenty-five_ *past* and *to* the hour, as well as _half past_ and on the hour.
